# Map-ISS

Brief Description:

This is my first try to work with APIs and request data from the server using JSON. The page shows you the live destination of ISS(International Space Station).
In addition, if you are more interested in exactly what ISS is and have questions about it, you will be able to find out this information using clicking on Details
button on the page.

Technologies:

HTML
CSS
JS

As I said, it is my first try to use JSON and get live data from the server. I add some CSS animation to this page to improve user interface, too.
